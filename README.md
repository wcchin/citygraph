note:
This is a simulation of moving vehicles on the streets network, that they turn randomly at the junctions, or following a turning proportion that is calculated based on FBPR.
The random turn simulation:

Using vehicle detector for the calibration in a modified PageRank, the moving process and turning proportion is simulated in this video:
